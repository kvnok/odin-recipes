	<p>Fondant potatoes, also called pommes de terre fondantes, is a French side dish. In this dish, potatoes are cut into cylinders, then pan-fried on both sides. After that roasted in the oven in a stock and butter sauce.</p>
	<h3>Ingredients</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>3 large whole russet potatoes</li>
		<li>2 tablespoons high-heat-resistant vegetable oil</li>
		<li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
		<li>4 sprigs thyme, plus more for garnish</li>
		<li>half a cup chicken broth, or more as needed</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Steps</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C)</li>
		<li>Cut off ends of russet potatoes. Stand potatoes on end, and peel them from top to bottom with a sharp knife to make each potato into a uniform cylinder. Cut each cylinder in half crosswise to make 6 potato cylinders about 2 inches long.</li>
		<li>Place potatoes into a bowl of cold water for about 5 minutes to remove starch from the outsides</li>
		<li>Heat vegetable oil in a heavy oven-proof skillet over high heat until it shimmers slightly</li>
		<li>Pat dry potatoes with paper towels. Place potato cylinders with the best-looking ends into the hot oil. Reduce heat to medium-high, and pan-fry potatoes until well-browned, 5 to 6 minutes. Season with salt and black pepper.</li>
		<li>Flip potatoes and repeat on the other ends. As they cook, use a paper towel held with tongs to carefully blot out the oil from the skillet. Add butter and thyme sprigs to the skillet.</li>
		<li>Pick up a thyme sprig with tongs and use it to paint butter over the top of the potatoes. Cook until butter foams and foam turns from white to a pale tan color. Season with more salt and pepper. Pour chicken stock into skillet.</li>
		<li>Transfer the skillet to the preheated oven and cook until potatoes are tender and creamy inside, about 30 minutes. If potatoes aren't tender, add 1/4 cup more stock and cook for 10 more minutes.</li>
		<li>Place potatoes on a serving platter. Spoon thyme-scented butter remaining in skillet over potatoes. Garnish with thyme sprigs. Let cool about 5 minutes before serving.</li>
