	<p>These smashed potatoes are twice-cooked to get that tender potato with crispy skin.<br>These delicious morsels are infused with olive oil, butter, garlic, and herbs for incredible flavor.</p>
	<h3>Ingredients</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>1 and a half pounds small yellow-fleshed potatoes</li>
		<li>half a cup olive oil</li>
		<li>2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar</li>
		<li>1 teaspoon butter at room temperature</li>
		<li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
		<li>1 teaspoon dried rosemary</li>
		<li>half a teaspoon dried sage</li>
		<li>half a teaspoon ground thyme</li>
		<li>half a teaspoon dried savory</li>
		<li>half a teaspoon sea salt</li>
		<li>half a teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Steps</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>Place potatoes in a saucepan; fill with enough water to cover potatoes. Bring to a boil; reduce heat to medium-low and cook potatoes until tender but not mushy, about 15 to 20 minutes. Drain potatoes in a colander; transfer to a baking sheet lined with a clean dish towel and allow to cool and dry out a little, about 10 minutes.</li>
		<li>While potatoes are cooling, mix olive oil, balsamic vinegar, butter, garlic, rosemary, sage, thyme, savory, salt, and pepper in a bowl until well combined.</li>
		<li>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
		<li>Place cooled potatoes in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet. Use a potato masher or the heel of your hand to lightly press down on potatoes to crush them. Spoon the oil-herb mixture over each smashed potato.</li>
		<li>Bake potatoes in the preheated oven until crispy, about 25 minutes. Let cool slightly before serving.</li>
